<p>Empirical laws, scientific theories and concepts are often hard to digest, particularly for the general public, or if you are just starting out in the field.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, I will use this platform to introduce a range of concepts in my field (palaeobiology/macroecology) via short blog posts. To ensure these are useful to a broad audience, I will limit these posts to 500 words or less, and avoid jargon wherever possible… the thing we all hate most! I hope these posts will prove insightful and help to improve your understanding without diving deep into the literature… I am sure I will learn a thing or two along the way!</p>
<p>Until then… remember to be kind to yourself and others… these are difficult times (#@$! you COVID).</p>
